# **Third-Order Letter Approximation Model & ELIZA Chatbot**

## **Project Overview**

This project is made up of two main code sections:

- **Third-Order Letter Approximation Model**
    - Analyses trigram patterns in English texts.
    - Attempts to generate sentences that are grammatically realistic.
    - This allows us to understand how simple statistical models can identify and predict common sequences in language.
    - This is very interesting learn about, espceially for more advanced uses like in AI text generation.
  
- **ELIZA Chatbot**
    - Engages in empathetic, conversational interactions with users.
    - Responds based on user inputs using pattern matching.
    - This allows us to demonstrate how pattern matching and rule-based logic can help simulate meaningful, human-like conversations.
    - It is very interesting to learn about AI's role in real-world applications like real-time communication and mental health support.


## **History**

## **Features**

### **Third-Order Letter Approximation Model**

- Text Cleaning: Accesses a Gutenburg text and returns a cleaned version of it which only contains uppercase letters, single spaces, and periods.
- Trigram Model: This is gerenrated by counting each sequence of three characters in the cleaned test, a count of each unique trigram is then kept in a dictionary.
- Text Generation: Using an initial seed of "TH", a new text is produced using trigram-based probabilities.
- Text Analysis: New Text is analysed to see what percentage of it contains recognisable English words.
- Trigram Model Export: Model is saved as a JSON file for future reuse.

### **ELIZA Chatbot**
- Setup to discuss a person's feelings and why they are feeling that way.
- Recognises emotion from messages and responds appropriately and empathetically.
- Uses Regex for pattern matching responses.
- Memory system, randomised responses and a typing indicator are used to try to simulate a human responder.
- Deployed on Github Pages so it can be used from any browser.

## **Installation and Deployment**

### **Third-Order Letter Approximation Model**

- Clone repository: git clone https://github.com/Cpgeragh/Emerging-Technologies.git.
- Open in Visual Studio Code.
- Install latest verison of python.
- Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Copy texts you want to process into data/ directory.

### **ELIZA Chatbot**

- Clone repository: git clone https://github.com/Cpgeragh/Emerging-Technologies.git.
- Open in Visual Studio Code.
- Install latest verison of python.

## **How to Run**

### **Third-Order Letter Approximation Model**

- Execute each cell in order using ctrl + return.
- This will build the trigram model, generate the new text, analayse the real word count percentage , and export the model as trigrams.json.

### **ELIZA Chatbot**

- Deploy the chatbot locally: python -m http.server 5500.
- Open http://localhost:5500/eliza/ to access the chat.

#### Alternatively

- Access via Github Spaces: https://cpgeragh.github.io/Emerging-Technologies/


## **Development Difficulties**

### **Third-Order Letter Approximation Model**

#### Handling Edge Cases in Text Cleaning

- Challenge: The input texts contained special characters and non-ASCII symbols, making the cleaning process complex.
- Solution: A rigorous text cleaning function was implemented to filter out unwanted characters and normalize the text. This ensured that the model processed consistent and usable input.
- Reflection: Fine-tuning the cleaning patterns required a lot of testing, as it had to be certain that important characters like spaces and periods were retained while other elements weren't missed unexpectadly.

#### Valid Word Percentage Analysis

- Challenge: Determining the percentage of valid English words in the generated text required loading and processing a large word list efficiently.
- Solution: A set-based lookup was implemented for the word list, which improved the performance of the comparison step. Additionally, tests were added to ensure the accuracy of the word list and checking for any duplicate words in it that might throw off valid word counts.
- Reflection: The importance of optimizing operations when working with large datasets is clear to see and very nescessary.

### **ELIZA Chatbot**

#### Balancing Simplicity and Realism

- Challenge: ELIZA relies on simple rule-based logic using regular expressions, but achieving realistic and engaging conversations with such a system was difficult.
- Solution: A memory system was developed that tracked the user's last emotion and allowed follow-up responses to feel more personalized and human-like. Randomized responses also added variety to conversations, reducing the feeling of repetitiveness.
- Reflection: While ELIZA is not a true AI, small enhancements like memory and follow-ups made it much more engaging.

#### Emotion Detection and Ambiguity

- Challenge: Users often input ambiguous or multi-emotion messages which made it hard to determine the correct response.
- Solution: Responses to address the most prominent emotions in a message were prioritised. For ambiguous inputs, fallback responses were added to encourage users to clarify or share more.
- Reflection: This required refining the regex patterns and adding fallback logic.

#### User Experience Enhancements

- Challenge: Making the chatbot feel human-like required features such as a typing indicator and natural response delays.
- Solution: A visible typing indicator and a 1-second delay before responses was added, simulating a human responder.
- Reflection: Small improvements had a good impact on the chatbotâ€™s realism, showing how important design details are for user engagement.
